    },
    {
        question: "Why is Nigeria filtered?",
        answer: "It's filtered because any time somebody uses it, it's to bypass the filter. There is little to no scenario in which this word and other similarly-spelled words to the N word are used correctly, so @everyone cannot use them anymore.",

        answer: "You can do this at lvl 40+ or with @‚≠êMerch Owner",
    },
    {
        question: "Why did that count as spam if there's slowmode?",
        answer: "Repeatedly posting the same thing is still spam, also posting large blocks of text disregards slowmode completely and is annoying.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why is swearing againts the rules",
        answer: "Swearing results in toxicity and causes the server to be an unfriendly environment, however, lvl 50+ unlocks a special chat where users can be trusted to do this.",
